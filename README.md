# Text to Speech Highlighter
This program was made for EngHacks 2021.

## Inspiration
Our inspiration from one of our members who was could speak Chinese but could not read it, so it was always a hassle when reading a Chinese website. Google Translate wasn't always accurate, nor would it help him learn the language. It was simply too cumbersome to copy every other word to another tab to read, so we decided to make a chrome extension to make the process simpler and faster.

## What It Does
It's a chrome extension that allows the user to highlight a piece of text, and have it read out to you, along with a translation by Google Translate.
